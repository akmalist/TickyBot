# TickyBot

In this Pre-work Solo Project I cloned TickyBot app from Chingu
https://tickybott.herokuapp.com

Instructions can be found here:

For this project I used modern techniques such as vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I used CSS flexbox, media queries, a naming system like BEM, and semantic HTML tags. I did not not use frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap.

This is my own final version:
